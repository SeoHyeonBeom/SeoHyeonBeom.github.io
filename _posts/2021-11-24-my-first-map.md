# Map Service - Using Naver API

## Introduction for My First Map

Map service is a project that can quickly, easily and accurately understand web development.

**What can we learn and gain from this project?**


**1. Establishing a basic initial environment to develop the web.**

Figure 2 - Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

Figure 3 - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development.

Figure 4 - Express. js is a framework based on Node. js for which is used for building web-application using approaches and principles of Node.





**2. Establishing a web-based map service through Naver Map api.**

## During working this project..

I had fun developing apps, but in fact, I was not interested in web development and was not interested. However, after the coronavirus broke out, map services began to emerge rapidly, and I started to know how this service was implemented. Through the map service, I naturally learned what web development is. It wasn't easy to watch, study, and practice lectures alone, but I'm proud to see the results.

Although it is a simple map service, it is my first web, and it is a fascinating and fun experience to be able to do all the functions of the webs than I thought.




# Future Work

The Covid-19 Map service has the function of updating corona confirmed patients in real time, and it takes too much time and money to reproduce there. I first knew that I had to manually update the number of confirmed cases every time, and that the more users I had, the more funds I needed to maintain web services. In the future, I will create a wonderful web page on time to receive investment from many companies and create a web page that can have a beneficial impact on people.
